# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know how to play the game? Do you know how to score in the game? |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are there enough controls for you? Is the restart menu easy to use?     |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you find the game fun? Do you like the art style?                    |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash? Are there any bugs/errors in the game?             |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the game intuitive to play?                                         |

Listed below are the results to the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/B3YN9N8). I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

## User Feedback

### Effective

I asked this question as it is essential to know what you are doing when you play, and not knowing removes some of the fun factor of the game, as you're 'stumbling around' figuring it out. Additionally knowing how to score in the game is essential to be able to try and improve your high score in the game.

From the feedback I've gotten, the game provides enough information about how to play, and is easy enough to pick up for new players.

From the feedback I got the game gives clear instructions on how to score, and is obvious for most players.&#x20;

### Efficient

Asking if there's enough controls is a good place to start to find out if you've got enough controls or if there needs to be more. Futhermore a well designed menu means that the player doesn't spend all their time in the menu trying to get to play, and instead spend their time actually playing.&#x20;

This shows that the menu is easy enough to use when the player dies and this means that the UI is intuitve and will be easy enough to use.&#x20;

### Engaging

Finding out if the game is fun or not is the key question as that's the main purpose of a game. Without this there's no point in playing. The art style of the game contributes to this too, and makes it more appealing to the audience when they play.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.53.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This feedback is decisive in showing that the game is fun, but it might need more to be more entertaining, however I think that within the scope of the game this is a good result.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.54.41.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows me that people overall like the aesthetic of the game and that it is engaging and will keep players playing the game over time.&#x20;

### Error Tolerant

Finding out if the game crashes or not is key to finding out if the game is error tolerant, as it means the game is able to catch errors or if it would simply crash as soon as something went wrong. This is followed up by checking if the game does have any errors or bugs as this makes it possible to find out if the game is going wrong in places, and allows me to fix it in the code.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.55.27 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows me that the game is both not creating any game breaking errors and that it is able to be error tolerant and that means that it can work around errors.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.57.52.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.58.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There's a large number of people who have experience the enemies all spawning on the left side of the screen. This is a bug and needs to be fixed ASAP.

### Easy to Learn

The game needs to be intuitive to make it easy to first pick up and learn, and shouldn't get in the way of more experienced players as ths would detract from the ability to become more skillful at the game and to test your abilites.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 09.16.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game is intuitive and is easy to learn and pick up for new players so this means that new players are more likely to start playing.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 09.17.01.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Overall most players seemed to like my game and found it fun to play. I think this score is good for the scope of the project and means that the game is challenging and engaging for the players.&#x20;

# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know how to play the game? Do you know how to score in the game? |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are there enough controls for you? Is the restart menu easy to use?     |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you find the game fun? Do you like the art style?                    |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash? Are there any bugs/errors in the game?             |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the game intuitive to play?                                         |

Listed below are the results to the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/B3YN9N8). I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

## User Feedback

### Effective

I asked this question as it is essential to know what you are doing when you play, and not knowing removes some of the fun factor of the game, as you're 'stumbling around' figuring it out. Additionally knowing how to score in the game is essential to be able to try and improve your high score in the game.

From the feedback I've gotten, the game provides enough information about how to play, and is easy enough to pick up for new players.

From the feedback I got the game gives clear instructions on how to score, and is obvious for most players.&#x20;

### Efficient

Asking if there's enough controls is a good place to start to find out if you've got enough controls or if there needs to be more. Futhermore a well designed menu means that the player doesn't spend all their time in the menu trying to get to play, and instead spend their time actually playing.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.52.06.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There could be more controls for some people, which may be due to the automatic shooting. Otherwise most people think that there are enough controls, and they don't mind the automatic shooting. This may be a preference, so it might be that a toggle to switch from automatic to manual shooting is required to tailor the game for a wider auidence.&#x20;

This shows that the menu is easy enough to use when the player dies and this means that the UI is intuitve and will be easy enough to use.&#x20;

### Engaging

Finding out if the game is fun or not is the key question as that's the main purpose of a game. Without this there's no point in playing. The art style of the game contributes to this too, and makes it more appealing to the audience when they play.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.53.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This feedback is decisive in showing that the game is fun, but it might need more to be more entertaining, however I think that within the scope of the game this is a good result.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.54.41.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows me that people overall like the aesthetic of the game and that it is engaging and will keep players playing the game over time.&#x20;

### Error Tolerant

Finding out if the game crashes or not is key to finding out if the game is error tolerant, as it means the game is able to catch errors or if it would simply crash as soon as something went wrong. This is followed up by checking if the game does have any errors or bugs as this makes it possible to find out if the game is going wrong in places, and allows me to fix it in the code.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.55.27 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows me that the game is both not creating any game breaking errors and that it is able to be error tolerant and that means that it can work around errors.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.57.52.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 08.58.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There's a large number of people who have experience the enemies all spawning on the left side of the screen. This is a bug and needs to be fixed ASAP.

### Easy to Learn

The game needs to be intuitive to make it easy to first pick up and learn, and shouldn't get in the way of more experienced players as ths would detract from the ability to become more skillful at the game and to test your abilites.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 09.16.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game is intuitive and is easy to learn and pick up for new players so this means that new players are more likely to start playing.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-04 at 09.17.01.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Overall most players seemed to like my game and found it fun to play. I think this score is good for the scope of the project and means that the game is challenging and engaging for the players.&#x20;

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game is challenging but completable.                              |
| 4         | The game gets more difficult as you progress.                         |
| 6         | All puzzles should not require more than 1 person.                    |
| 21        | The game must be appropriate for the age of the audience of the game. |

These criteria are essential for making sure that the game is properly usable by the intended players and that the game is properly suited for each player. Additionally it tests that the game isn't broken by needing more than two players and that the game is more difficult as you play futher into the endless mode.&#x20;

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-06 at 11.27.56.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This questions allows me to see if the game gets more difficult as you play, and this means that there is a natural progression in the game, and means that you would have to improve your skill to get a higher score.&#x20;

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-06 at 11.28.44.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is an majority of people who find the game challenging enough and this means that the game is difficult enough to be engaging but not so difficult that it's hard to play.&#x20;

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-06 at 11.29.31.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This means that none of the game needs to have two or more players to be able to complete it.&#x20;

### Criterion 21

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-06 at 11.30.02 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This means that the game is suitable for all ages, and it means that it is correctly tailored to the age range, but doesn't stop anyone older from playing.&#x20;

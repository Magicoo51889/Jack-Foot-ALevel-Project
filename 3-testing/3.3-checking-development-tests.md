# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

These are a collection of the tests that add to the overall player experience and are relevant to the success criteria. They are tests based on each development in each cycle and they are designed to test that the new features work as intended and that they all work in this final version of the game, before future development outside of this project.&#x20;

They are in chronological order as they are in the cycles, except that they are all in one table.&#x20;

### Tests

| Test | Instructions     | What I expect                                     | What actually happens                                                                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code         | Page to load and be rendered to fit the screen    | Page loads after compiling and all renders, whilst fitting to screen                    | Pass      |
| 2    | Press arrow keys | Arrow keys allow basic movement of sprite on page | The arrow keys allow me to move the sprite, but would like to use WASD and for rotation | Pass      |

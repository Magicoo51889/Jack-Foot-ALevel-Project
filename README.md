# 2D Space Game

### Packages and software used
- **[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)** - This is being used as a way to easily and quickly update and change the documentation for my project.
- **[Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/)** - This is the game engine used to create the game. It has physics built in and has more advanced features such as better inputting using keyboard and mouse. 
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** - This is the bundler I'm using to be able to work on my program whilst it is running as this allows me to quickly test different parts of code much quicker, than fully building and running the application. 

### Gameplay
- The gameplay will be similar to space invaders, where you fly along different planet's surfaces to be able to kill different enemies, in waves.
- You will also be able to explore 5 different planets, with different enemies and difficulties.

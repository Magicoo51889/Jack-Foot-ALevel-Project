# 2D Space Factory Game

### Packages and software used
- **[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)** - This is being used as a way to easily and quickly update and change the documentation for my project.
- **[Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/)** - This is the game engine used to create the game. It has physics built in and has more advanced features such as better inputting using keyboard and mouse. 
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - This a great hosting service that I used to host my project on. It allows me to host the game for free, and be able to develop the game without the end game being affected. 
- **[Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/)** - This is a great way to bundle all of the files together and make it easier to use. This allows for quick and easy development of the game too through a localhost server.

### Gameplay
- This game is based around flying a space ship to different planets and using resources on those planest to be able to build new ships and upgrades. You will collect resources manually to begin with, but you will develop new technology and be able to build factories to automate the process for you.
- The game is a 2D game, but you can use the WASD (or arrow) keys to move the ship around and use the mouse to be able to click and drag to move the camera around, so that you can pan over your factory.

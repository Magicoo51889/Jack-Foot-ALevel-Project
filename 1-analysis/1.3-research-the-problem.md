## Asteroids

### Overview

Asteroids is the beginning of the 2D space game. The aim of the game is to destroy the asteroids and the enemy UFOs whilst not colliding with either of the two, and whilst also avoiding the enemy's fire. As time progresses the number of asteroids increases too, making the game progressively harder.  This game was one of the biggest hits in the 70s and 80s, whilst also being one of the highest sold games at the time. The graphics and movement were very simple but the new idea was revolutionary and made the game interesting to a wide range of people, allowing for people to be enticed to a new form of entertainment. This game also allowed for many people to become extremely good at it and first began the idea of e-sports as  there were competitions for who could get the highest score.&#x20;

### Controls

Asteriods was originally played on old arcade cabinets, and eventually ported for home systems such as the Atari, which was a popular console in the 80s. The arcade cabinets and the atari systems both used joysticks to be able to move the spaceship and this means that the controls were basic XY movement, and rotation. These controls are super intuitive and they are also easy to pick up and learn. This allows the game to be easy to learn and play for newcommers and allows the game to be open for a wide range of players.&#x20;

There were also some arcade cabinets that used buttons to play, similar to arrow keys and this is an idea that I would use on my game too, as they are also intuitive and easy to learn. This also means that it is easier to port to other hardware as the controls work for the arrow keys, as well as WASD and other key combinations.&#x20;

These simple controls also allow for the skill of each player to be truly shown as it completely relies on the speed and reactions of the player to be able to keep the ship alive. This means that this game truly reflects the difficulty of each level and how the player responds to the level.&#x20;

### Story and World

The world of asteroids is generated by spawning asteroids off screen and them floating into the view of the player. The player is able to go off the edge of the screen and come back on at the opposite side of the screen. The asteroids and the UFOs also do this but they aren't able to shoot off the side of the screen, unlike the player can. The camera for every level is static and doesn't move based off of the player, but instead the objects in the world move around, and so does the player.&#x20;

There isn't really a story to the game, however there is the premise of surviving against the waves of UFOs and be able to live for as long as you can. This gives the feeling of survival and that the player needs to live as long as they can against the opposition. Many games today use this idea and is still one of the most popular genre's.&#x20;

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extremely basic graphics | Using more fancy graphics is more gripping for the player, and the really basic graphics can be difficult to keep track of everything, as it all looks very similar.   |
| Restarting after death   | This would become extremely irritating to play, to make factories. Instead simply loosing inventory or items would be annoying, but not as detrimental as restarting.  |

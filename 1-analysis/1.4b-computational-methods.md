# 1.4b Computational Methods

Computational Thinking is all about how you tackle and issue and you solve the issue that is faced ahead of you and how you went about fixing that issue and improving the thing you're working on. It is a way of thinking, and making problems be turned into an algorithm that you can more easily tackle and figure out solutions to. Using computational methods allows me to be more efficient in my coding and be able to create a useful solution to a problem, and this is why I will be using them in my project for the following features:&#x20;

* Computational methods allow for saving systems which allow for me to be able to accurately and quickly fetch where the player has saved and their progress.&#x20;
* the game is able to pick up the key inputs and translate that into movement in game which is essential for the player to interact with the game.&#x20;
* The game needs to have a graphic element to it so that the player is able to properly see what is happening and react to what is going on. This will also need the implementation of physics such as acceleration for things to move and react realistically.&#x20;

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the act of simplifiying a problem into its core components and removing any unnecessary details. Thinking abstractly is essential for the development of a game as it means that you are able to properly implement the game's core mechanics and features without being distracted by other problems, which makes the gameplay more enjoyable and improves the playability. The key ideas that I will use abstraction to focus on is:

* Puzzles and obstacles in game as these will require a focused and logical way to get past them, and allowing them to have a sense of purpose and placement in the map. This will also apply to enemies, which will have set routese and patrols or certain engagement ranges so that the player is able to react accordingly.
* The graphics of the game do not need to be cutting edge, as this doesn't particularly help with the development of the core featues, and a vector art style will be plenty for the scope of the project.&#x20;
* There needs to be a clear and sensible main menu and pause menu as this will allow the player to easily navigate the menu and inform them.  A fancy looking menu doesn't add much to the experience of the use and would distract from the core features of the game which is the key focus for the game.&#x20;

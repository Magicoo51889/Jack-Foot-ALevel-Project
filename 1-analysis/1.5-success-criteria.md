| 1        | The game is challenging but completable            | This keeps the player engaged but not to get frustrated with it.

| 2        | Enemies would give another challenge               | This gives the player a sense of the unknown and keeps them on their toes when playing, as there is an active danger to them.                          | [#level-design-and-layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout "mention")[#enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies "mention")[#puzzle](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#puzzle "mention")       |
| 3        | Each enemy is varied and has a unique visual to it | This give more to explore and keeps the player interested. These different planets act like levels, with them getting more dangerous as you progress.  | [#level-design-and-layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout "mention")[#graphics-and-design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-design "mention")                                                    |

| 6        | All puzzles should not require more than 1 person  | If there's any puzzle that requires the player to be in two places at once, then it's simply unplayable.                                               | [#level-design-and-layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout "mention")                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7        | Add waves to each enemy                            | This means that the game is more predictable and this in turn means that the game is testing the players skill.                                        | [#level-design-and-layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout "mention")[#enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies "mention")                                                                            |

| 14       | There must be a pause menu for the player with several options | This allows the player to get up and do something else without having to save and quit, or without having the game continue running in the background.                         | [#user-interface](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface "mention")                       |

| 17       | The menu must be clearly laid out and coloured appropriately   | The menu needs to be clear so that the player can easily navigate it and it needs to be properly coloured to game, or the planet colour you're selecting for example.          | [#user-interface](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface "mention")                       |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

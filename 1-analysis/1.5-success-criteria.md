### Level Design

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                    | Reference |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1        | Each Planet is varied and has a unique visual to it           | This give more to explore and keeps the player interested. These different planets act like levels, with them getting more dangerous as you progress.                            |           |
| 2        | The game is challenging but completable                       | This keeps the player engaged but not to get frustrated with it. If the game is too difficult no one will want to play it.                                                       |           |
| 3        | Enemies would give another challenge to each planet you go to | This gives the player a sense of the unknown and keeps them on their toes when playing, as there is an active danger to them.                                                    |           |
| 4        | The planets get more difficult as you progress                | There should be some increased risk when you go to a different planet to get better resources but maintaining the ability  to complete each planet.                              |           |
| 5        | There must be some sort of obstacle                           | Each planet must have an increasing blockade or obstacle that the player must get through to be able to progress further, making them problem solve.                             |           |
| 6        | All puzzles should not require more than 1 person             | If there's any puzzle that requires the player to be in two places at once, then it's simply unplayable. Could use boxes or another weight to activate a second switch however.  |           |

### Mechanics

| Ref. No. | Criterion                         | Justification                                                                                                                                                           | Reference |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 7        | The player must be able to move   | There's no game if you can't even move. This is a core mechanic to any game.                                                                                            |           |
| 8        | There must be collision detection | Otherwise you would be able to leave the map and wouldn't interact with the environment and enemies around you.                                                         |           |
| 9        | Fixed camera view                 | A fixed camera view allows for a wide view of what you're doing and the surrounding environment.                                                                        |           |
| 10       | Add acceleration to the player    | This makes the movement feel more natural and for them to have more control of the sprite on screen, as they are able to have small inputs rather than just large ones. |           |

### User Interface

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                      | Justification                                                                                                                                                                  | Reference |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 11       | There must be a menu for the player                            | This allows for easy and quick navigation to continue or restart the game. It should be easy to use and make sense for the player.                                             |           |
| 12       | The player must smoothly change between planets                | The menu should allow the player to select from the planets they have unlocked which they'd like to start on.                                                                  |           |
| 13       | There must be a pause menu for the player with several options | This allows the player to get up and do something else without having to save and quit, or without having the game continue running in the background.                         |           |
| 14       | The game must save                                             | Without saving the player would have to restart everything when they come back which would get extremely infuriating for the player, and the game would be unpopular.          |           |
| 15       | The player should be allowed to restart if they like           | There must be a way for the user to restart the game from the main menu or the pause menu (or both) so that they are able to try the game again and try a different approach.  |           |
| 16       | The menu must be clearly laid out and coloured appropriately   | The menu needs to be clear so that the player can easily navigate it and it needs to be properly coloured to game, or the planet colour you're selecting for example.          |           |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                     | Justification                                                                                                                                                                  | Reference |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 21       | The game must run without crashing for an extended time       | Crashes make the game annoying to play and it draws the player out of the game.                                                                                                |           |
| 22       | The game must run at at least 30 frames per second            | The game must be smooth to play and not jittery or hard to see what's happening. Any lower and the game becomes more difficult to play and doesn't provide a good experience.  |           |
| 23       | Each area will be varied and have something different         | This makes the game more interesting to play and allows for more exploration and keeps the player playing for longer.                                                          |           |
| 24       | The game must be appropriate for the age audience of the game | A game should be suited for the people that are likely to be playing it and should not go out of those guidlines through the duration of the game.                             |           |

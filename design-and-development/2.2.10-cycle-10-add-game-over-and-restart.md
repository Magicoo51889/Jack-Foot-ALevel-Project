# 2.2.11 Cycle 11 - Add Game Over and Restart

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to add a restart and game over menu which will come up when the player dies, and this will allow the player to quickly restart if they die using a GUI, which is far nicer than having to refresh the page.&#x20;

* [x] Add a restart button
* [x] Add a game over screen

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gameOver      | This is the variable that parses the gameOver data to the html code.      |
| restart       | This is the variable that parses the restart data to the html code.       |
| explosion     | This is the variable that stores the animation for the player exploding.  |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Game.js" %}
{% code title="Game.js" %}
```javascript
const gameOver = document.querySelector('.gameover');
const restart = document.querySelector('.restart');
//Function killPlayer removes the player from the game
function killPlayer() {
  let explosion = game.add.sprite(player.x - 50, player.y - 80, 'explosion');
  explosion.scale.set(4);
  explosion.animations.add('boom');
  explosion.play('boom', 15, false, true);
  player.kill();

  setInterval(function() {
    Phaser.GAMES[0].paused = true;
  }, 500);

  if (laser) {
    laser.kill();
  }

  restart.classList.remove('display-none');
  gameOver.style.display = 'initial';

  restart.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    location.reload();
  });
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="index.html" %}
{% code title="index.html" %}
```html
<div id="game-wrapper">
        <h1 class="score">Score: 0</h1>
        <h1 class="gameover">GAME OVER</h1>
        <div class="restart display-none">RESTART</div>
        <h5 id="health">Health: 200</h5>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

I was implementing this feature at the same time as I was adding the pause menu, so I was having the same issue where I wasn't declaring the html variables that link this data in the javascript to the html code, and this meant that it was erroring as there was no data.&#x20;

I also had a typo with adding the explosion animation that meant the code was erroring when the player was killed and this meant that it wasn't reaching the code with the restart and the game over menu.&#x20;

## Testing

Evidence for testing

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>What actually happens</th><th data-type="select">Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Crash the player ship</td><td>The menu should appear and so should the restart button. The restart button should glow yellow when you hover over it. </td><td>Nothing comes up. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Crash the player ship</td><td>The menu should appear and so should the restart button. The restart button should glow yellow when you hover over it. </td><td>As expected</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

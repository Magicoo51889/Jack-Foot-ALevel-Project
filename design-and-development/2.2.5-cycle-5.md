# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

In this cycle I am going to make the enemy move from one side of the screen to the other and then move back across again, much like the screenWrap module I had used previously. I also want to make the movement seem really smooth and seamless, as this engages the player more.&#x20;

* [x] Get the enemy to move to the side
* [x] Enemy wraps over the edge of the screen and reappears again

### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LEFT          | This is the constant that sets the left hand side of the screen, minus the width of the sprite. This makes it look more seamless.  |
| RIGHT         | This is the constant that sets the right hand side of the screen to the screenWrap function                                        |
| SPEED         | This is the speed at which the player moves to the side at.                                                                        |

### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>

```
procedure create
    LEFT = 0
    RIGHT = 100
    SPEED = 10
    loop start
        for 10
            this.x + speed
        end for
        this.x = 0   
    loop end
end procedure
```

        this.x += speed;
        screenWrap(this, LEFT, RIGHT);

    }

### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

The biggest challenge with this cycle was making the enemy move as I had more issues with the documentation of Phaser being out of date and this caused me to try multiple different solutions, before using the basic x and y coordinates and simply adding and subtracting from them.

I also had a small issue with getting the width of the player and enemy to parse into the screenWrap module, but I soon found out how to do it and then I simply worked out the logic that I needed on a piece of paper, and then implemented that logic into the module so that the sprite didn't jump from one side of the screen to the other, in a loop as it would trigger both parts of the function at the same time, causing the sprite to become 'invisible'.

## Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

In my testing I used the webpack software to keep making small changes to the speed constant to be able to find a speed that I thought would be slow enough for the player to react to it and yet fast enough for it to be challenging to hit.

# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to add a score count, which changes based on the number of enemies shot, and the different types of enemies that have been shot. It'll also give more points to the player if they pick up health. This gives another incentive for the player to pick up health and will mean that they can boost their score by picking up items.

Additionally I added the ability for the game to store the highscore locally which means that when the player comes back the next time they play, their previous best score is stored, and this allows the player to try and beat their best, without having to write it down themselves, or remeber it. This makes the game more likely to keep the player playing as it is more easy to come back to and try and beat their previous score.&#x20;

* [ ] Add a score count on screen
* [x] Add a method that adds the score
* [x] Store the high score locally

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| score         | This is the variable that holds the score.                                                                                                                 |
| newHighScore  | This is the variable that is stored locally to hold the high score from each play they have. This gets overwritten when they score higher than previously. |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure increaseScore
  score += 10;
  scoreText = "Score: score"
  if score > newHighscore then newHighscore = score  
  highscore = "High Score: newHighscore";
  set 'High-Score' to newHighscore); // Set highscore in local storage
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Game.js" %}
{% code title="Game.js" %}
```javascript
//Function increaseScore increases the players score by 10
function increaseScore() {
  score += 10;
  scoreText.innerHTML = `Score: ${score}`;
  if (score > newHighscore) {
    newHighscore = score;
  }
  const highscore = document.querySelector('.highscore');
  highscore.innerHTML = `High Score: ${newHighscore}`;
  localStorage.setItem('High-Score', newHighscore); // Set highscore in local storage
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

It was challenging to get the score to be detected as a variable for the innerHTML as it kept saying that the variable was null. I used breakpoints to be able to identify what was happening in the program and found that

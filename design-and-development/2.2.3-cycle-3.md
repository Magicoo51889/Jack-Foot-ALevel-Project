# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

In this cycle I aim to be creating an enemy class that I can re-use to reduce the amount of code being written, so that the game is smaller to load and run. This makes it less intensive for slower computers and means that my code is better structured and easier to read/debug.

Furthermore I will be implementing a key system to be able to identify different objects in the game so that I can track what object is which with a simple sting of characters, which could be in 4 bit binary as this would allow for 16 different unique keys for things such as the player or the player's lasers, or the enemies.

* [ ] Create enemy class
* [ ] Unique object keys

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[OBJECT]\_CATEGORY | This constant is one that is assigned to each different object, which is unique to that one object, and makes identifying each object easier.  |

# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

In this cycle I aim to be able to add the enemy ships to the top of the screen and for them to move downwards, and whilst doing this they will spawn in patterns occasionally, with other ships around them.&#x20;

Using patterns will make the game more immersive as it adds another layer to the game where the player may recognise patterns and use this to their advantage to play more strategically.&#x20;

* [x] Create enemy group
* [x] Add enemy ships to that group
* [x] Enemy ships spawn in
* [x] There are diffrent patterns the enemies follow

### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable Name      | Use                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| switchXspawn       | This is the indicator that tells which X spawn to use. |
| switchToNewPattern | This indicates which pattern to use ( 0 , 10, 20, 30). |
| enemyXSpawn        | These are different base places to use on the screen.  |
| Enemy\_X           | This is the enemies x coordinate from enemyXSpawn.     |

### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

It was very challenging to work out the logic behind the spawning of the enemies, and how to implement different patterns of the different waves of enemies. This was challenging as I didn't just want to use a json file to set where each enemy would be, I wanted it to be arithmetic based, so that it would adapt to different resolutions and widths of the game, which a json wouldn't be able to do.&#x20;

From this I thought that the best way to do this would be to have a set of different base places the enemies would spawn from, and then I would add or subtract to that to create patterns.&#x20;

This method worked suprisingly well when I tested it and I'm really proud of how it worked, as it took a long time to create and think up of.&#x20;

## Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

During testing I found that the pattern worked really well after many hours of trying different tweaks to the method. &#x20;

### What Next?

* Next I'm going to implement sounds into the game to make it more immersive and realistic

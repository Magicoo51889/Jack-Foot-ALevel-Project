# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

In this cycle I aim to make the enemy class that will allow me to split my code up into modules, which will make debugging and adding more features to the game later down the line, easier. This is a good programming practise to have as it allows for different modules and components to be added later on with ease and to be able to quickly and easily change the existing features of a program. Furthermore I will add a player class to be able to do the same with the player, as this will allow making the player more customisable and easier to modify for me later on.&#x20;

* [x] Create entity class
* [x] Add player to the entity class
* [x] Create enemy class
* [x] Enemy loads into the game

Further on with my development, I've also realised that having an Entity class which I can use to extend upon with my player class and enemy class, will further improve the structure of my code, and also enables me to add features to sprites more broadly, and adds an additional layer of abstraction to the code.&#x20;

### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[OBJECT]\_CATEGORY | This constant is one that is assigned to each different object, which is unique to that one object, and makes identifying each object easier.                                                                                                             |
| Entity              | This is the parent class that all my sprites will inherit to be able to simplify my code and to make it easier to add sprites in the future                                                                                                               |
| Enemy               | This is the parent class of any enemies that I make, and it will allow me to add enemies quickly and easily, whilst also reducing the amout of code that I write, reducing the size of the game, and making debugging easier.                             |
| Player              | This will be a child class that extends the entity class, and this will not be used to make anything else, as this is simply just the player. It will reduce the complexity of making the player however as it is done via the same process as my enemy.  |

### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

It was quite challenging to work out and figure what functionality I first needed in my enemy class to be able to get it to work, and I needed to figure out what would be essential and found in every enemy that I made. This means that every enemy I made had to have all of these common features, so it was essential that I got them right.&#x20;

Implementing the enemy into the game was a bit tricky to begin with as there's not much documentation on how to use a class as a sprite or game object, and you have to figure it out yourself. The way I did it allows me to use a function within the entity class itself to be able to make the enemy, and it does this by using the texture key that I pass into the class, to be able to then make the enemy or player later on with ease. This allows me to keep the enemy class separate from the main scene code, making it easier to debug and to modularise the program. Additionally working this out has given me the solution of how to implement the classes for the player and other enemies later on in the development cycles.&#x20;

Furthermore I've had the issue of getting the entire scene to load in, once I had added the player and enemy to the entity class. This was confusing for me as it had worked just fine before when I was using the just the enemy class and adding it to the scene. For some reason the code wasn't working when I tried to add the player, so I had to find another way of adding the class to the scene. I did this using the entity class which actually promotes better coding practise as it allows me to inherit different properties of parent classes later on in production, and makes each sprite separated into different classes with their own properties.&#x20;

Also getting the enemy's image to update was also challenging, as it initially wouldn't move, but the x and y values were changing, which lead me to believe that the image wasn't updating. I soon realised that there were actually two players in the scene, and this is due to the **`scene.add.existing(this)`** that I had put into the entity class I was extending. Once I had figured this out, I soon realised that I could remove the piece of code that was adding the second image of the player that didn't update, and I refactored the code so that it was passing in the texture into the class properly so that it updated and showed only one player, not two.&#x20;

## Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

During testing I found that using an additonal class that I could use to extend the player and enemy from was easier than using just the built in one from Phaser, as it allows me to customise what features and what variables I pass on into the other classes. This also allowed me to find the issues with the sprites not loading in faster, as I was able to add breakpoints to different parts of the code and debug them, and walk through the program to find where it was going wrong, and why.&#x20;

| Enemy moves side to side  | Nothing, this is automatic.  | The enemy should begin moving side to side as the game begins.                 | It stays completely still, but in the console it is logging the x\&y to be changing.                                | Fail      |
| Enemy moves side to side  | Nothing, this is automatic.  | As you move from side to side you should be able to see the enemy rotate too.  | Enemy's x and y coordinates are logged. The player loads in once, and updates properly when moving left and right.  | Pass      |

### Evidence <a href="#evidence" id="evidence"></a>

![The player behaving correctly with movement being logged to the console](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

### What Next?

Next I'm going to create a main menu that the player can interact with to begin the level and get the player to be able to have a graphical interface they can use, rather than the game just loading straight into the action. I will also add the pause menu, as this will allow the player to navigate back the main menu.

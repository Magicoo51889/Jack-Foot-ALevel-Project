# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to add boundaries to the game so that the player doesn't move off the edge of the screen as this causes issues when playing, as the player can't see their sprite.

* [x] Add screen boundaries

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name      | Use                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| collideWorldBounds | This is a part of Phaser 2 that allows you to set so the player doesn't move out of bounds. |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure create
...
    player collides with WorldBounds = true; //player cannot leave world bounds
...
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

From this I was able to create the code that allowed my player to move more fluidly and predictably, whilst being natural to use, and remaining similar to movement in a low gravity environment.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Game.js" %}
{% code title="Game.js" %}
```typescript
function create(){
...
  player.body.collideWorldBounds = true; //player cannot leave world bounds
...
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

I didn't find this part of the program too difficult as it was well documented and there were lots of examples online.

## Testing

Evidence for testing

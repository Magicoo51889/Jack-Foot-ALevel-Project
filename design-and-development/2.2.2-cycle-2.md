# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to improve the movement of the player before I go on to add maps and enemies, as this is a core mechanic of the game, and can make or break a game. At the moment the player physics are a bit clunky, and unnatural, so I want to make it a bit smoother and realisitic.&#x20;

* [ ] Realistic floating physics
* [ ] Player doesn't center back to 90 degrees imediately after stopping.&#x20;

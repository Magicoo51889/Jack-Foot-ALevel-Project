# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to improve the movement of the player before I go on to add maps and enemies, as this is a core mechanic of the game, and can make or break a game. At the moment the player physics are a bit clunky, and unnatural, so I want to make it a bit smoother and realistic. Doing this will probably involve altering the control.js file to be able to change how the 'floating' works, and using deacceleration of the ship to make it seem more realistic.&#x20;

Additionally the player doesn't hit a map boundary and stop. The player can move off of the map, and this is immersion breaking and doesn't look good. I want to make these boundaries around the edge of the map so that the player can't move into the background.

* [x] Easily controllable player
* [x] Add camera boundaries
* [x] Add screen wrap

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name  | Use                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| forceMagnitude | This is the variable that I use to be able to easily change the speed of the player when moving side to side |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure controls
    forceMagnitude = 10
  
    if keys.A or cursors.left is pressed
        PlayerX = PlayerX - forceMagnitude
    else if keys.D or cursors.right is pressed
        PlayerX  = PlayerX + forceMagnitude
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

From this I was able to create the code that allowed my player to move more fluidly and predictably, whilst being natural to use, and remaining similar to movement in a low gravity environment.&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="screenWrap.ts" %}
{% code title="screenWrap.ts" %}
```typescript
export default function screenWrap (sprite) { 
    if (sprite.x < 0){
        sprite.x = window.innerWidth;
        console.log("wrapping left")
    }
    else if (sprite.x > window.innerWidth){
        sprite.x = 0;
        console.log("wrapping right")
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="controls.ts" %}
{% code title="controls.ts" %}
```typescript
export default function controls(keys, cursors, player) {
  let forceMagnitude = 8;

  if (keys.A.isDown || cursors.left.isDown){
    console.log("A")
    player.x -= forceMagnitude
  } else if (keys.D.isDown || cursors.right.isDown){
    console.log("D")
    player.x += forceMagnitude
  }
  if (keys.T.isDown){
    console.log("reset")
    player.x = window.innerWidth / 2
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Challenges

What I found most challenging was getting Phaser's built in functions to work, as many of them weren't as simple as just doing **`player.setVelocity()`**and I found this quite difficult to find a solution to, as all the documentation for Phaser is quite lacking or outdated (made for Phaser 2.0 not 3.0 like what I'm using). Once I found what worked (which usually involved having to make my some big changes to the code elsewhere) I was quickly able to find a good movement speed.&#x20;

My solution to this was to use the player.x and player.y functionality which allows you to add and subtract from the player's x and y coordinates and this means that movement is simplified from the more complex, **`player.accelerationFromVelocity()`** or **`player.setVelocity()`** which refused to work when I was programming the game.&#x20;

* Getting Phaser to recognise the different functions.
* Find a way to get the player to move to the other side of the screen once they go off the screen.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                  | What I expect                                                  | What actually happens                                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Press the arrow keys or WASD.                 | The character to move accordingly based on each key.           | Rotation works but as soon as you try and move the game crashes.                            | Pass      |
| 2    | Press arrow keys or WASD till off the screen. | The player should 'wrap' over to the other side of the screen. | At first it would get stuck in a loop of being the x coordinate being equal for each side.  | Fail      |
| 3    | Press arrow keys or WASD till off the screen. | The player should 'wrap' over to the other side of the screen. | After some tweaks to the function, it now wraps over the page to the other side seamlessly  | Pass      |

# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to improve the movement of the player before I go on to add maps and enemies, as this is a core mechanic of the game, and can make or break a game. At the moment the player physics are a bit clunky, and unnatural, so I want to make it a bit smoother and realistic. Doing this will probably involve altering the control.js file to be able to change how the rotation works, and using a forward movement based off of the angle the ship is facing.&#x20;

Additionally the player doesn't hit a map boundary and stop. The player can move off of the map, and this is immersion breaking and doesn't look good. I want to make these boundaries around the edge of the map so that the player can't move into the background.

* [x] Realistic floating physics
* [x] Player doesn't centre back to 90 degrees immediately after stopping.&#x20;
* [x] Add map boundaries.&#x20;

# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

In this cycle I aim to add different sounds to different things I may implement into the game such as picking up health or the enemy being destroyed. I will also add a background track to the game so that the game is more emersive and fun.&#x20;

* [x] Add sounds for different things that happen in game
* [x] Add a background track

### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

In this cycle there were no issues at all with adding and playing songs or sound.

## Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

In my testing I used the webpack software to keep making small changes to the speed constant to be able to find a speed that I thought would be slow enough for the player to react to it and yet fast enough for it to be challenging to hit.

### Tests <a href="#tests" id="tests"></a>

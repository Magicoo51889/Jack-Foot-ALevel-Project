# 2.2.5.5 Cycle 5.5

As I was working on the laser funcitonality, I came up with an idea of improving the way that the speed the player moves at could be worked out. Before I had it set up so that the player's speed was a fixed number, and this meant that as you changed screen width, the speed was either very fast or very slow, and this made the game unpredictable and nearly impossible to play from a player's standpoint.&#x20;

To fix this I came up with the idea of calculating the player's speed based off of calculations on the player's window width, when they loaded in. This means that no matter what size screen you're playing on, the speed at which the player moves will always be constant, based off of the sensitivty you choose.&#x20;

This also gave me the option of varying the speed to different values, and makes it easier for me to implement different movement speeds that the player can choose from in the menu later on.&#x20;

### Outcome

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First Tab" %}
{% code title="controls.ts" %}
```typescript
export default function controls(keys, cursors, player) {

  // I will add these as options in the menu and pause menu so that people can select different sensitivites. 
  let hiSens = 120;
  let normSens = 90;
  let loSens = 60;
  let forceMagnitude = window.innerWidth/10000 * normSens; // This is where the sensitivty will be changed in the code

  if (keys.A.isDown || cursors.left.isDown){
    console.log("A")
    player.x -= forceMagnitude  // subtracts the angular force from the player's x position
  } else if (keys.D.isDown || cursors.right.isDown){
    console.log("D")
    player.x += forceMagnitude  // adds the angular force to the player's x position
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

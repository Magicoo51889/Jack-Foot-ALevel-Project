# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game is easy to understand how to play.                       | Success      |
| 2           | The game has a clear goal of achieving the highest score you can. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game only has one direction of travel the player can control, meaning they have to avoid the enemies and be able to achieve the highest score. This is suitable and from [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the players who tested the game said that the game was easy to understand on how to play, meaning this feature doesn't need to be edited or changed in the future.

### Feature 2

The game is clear in how you score points and it is highlights when you score points to make it even more obvious. From my user's feedback in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the users all knew how to achieve a high score, therefore this feature doesn't need to be changed in the future and is successful in its aim.&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                  | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | There are enough controls to play the game.  | Partial Success |
| 2           | The restart menu can be used easily.         | Success         |

### Feature 1

From my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the testers showed that for the majority of people there were enough controls, and this means it is successful. However there was also a proportion of people who wanted more controls, such as being able to control the lasers and when they fire. This is a small change needed for the feature in order for it to suit everyone, and is overall a partial success.&#x20;

### Feature 2

From my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") I can tell that the testers thought that the menu was intuitive and therefore this feature doesn't need any changes and is a success.&#x20;

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Game is interesting to play and fun  | Success      |
| 2           | Game Art                             | Success      |

### Feature 1

Overall the game is an enjoyable experience and is fun to play. This doesn't need to be changed, though it can be easily added to with other changes in the game such as new features outlined in [4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md "mention"). Overall success.&#x20;

### Feature 2

The game's art style is engaging and interesing to look at and adds to the player experience in a positive way. This feature doesn't need any changes and is a success.&#x20;

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Playing the game without crashes.                 | Success      |
| 2           | Able to play the game without game breaking bugs. | Fail         |

### Feature 1

The game does not crash and instead is very stable, even when there are bugs or unexpected behaviour. Overall doesn't need to be changed in the games current state, and so is a success.

### Feature 2

The game does contain 2 game breaking bugs, where you are able to play the game without having to kill any enemies, however it does not earn any points. You are able to sit on the far right side of the screen and you avoid all enemies, as they only spawn on the left side, due to a bug in the pattern generation of the enemies. Overall this is a fail as you can play as unintended.&#x20;

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game is intuitive to play and pick up | Success      |

### Feature 1

All the people who played my game in the [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") found the game easy to pick up and play and therefore is intuitive and well instructed on the purpose of the game. Overall a success.&#x20;

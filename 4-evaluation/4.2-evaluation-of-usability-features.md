# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game is easy to understand how to play.                       | Success      |
| 2           | The game has a clear goal of achieving the highest score you can. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game only has one direction of travel the player can control, meaning they have to avoid the enemies and be able to achieve the highest score. This is suitable and from [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the players who tested the game said that the game was easy to understand on how to play, meaning this feature doesn't need to be edited or changed in the future.

### Feature 2

The game is clear in how you score points and it is highlights when you score points to make it even more obvious. From my user's feedback in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the users all knew how to achieve a high score, therefore this feature doesn't need to be changed in the future and is successful in its aim.&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                  | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | There are enough controls to play the game.  | Partial Success |
| 2           | The restart menu can be used easily.         | Success         |

### Feature 1

From my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the testers showed that for the majority of people there were enough controls, and this means it is successful. However there was also a proportion of people who wanted more controls, such as being able to control the lasers and when they fire.&#x20;

This could be addressed by adding a button for firing the laser. The user could select from a choice of 'simple' or 'advanced' controls to change if they want the firing to be automatic or manual, with manual firing being more difficult and adding an extra challenge to the game.&#x20;

This is a small change needed for the feature in order for it to suit everyone, and is overall a partial success.&#x20;

### Feature 2

From my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") I can tell that the testers thought that the menu was intuitive and therefore this feature doesn't need any changes and is a success.&#x20;

## Engaging

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature No.</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="select">Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Game is interesting to play and fun </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Game Art</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1

Overall the game is an enjoyable experience and is fun to play. This doesn't need to be changed, though it can be easily added to with other changes in the game such as new features outlined in [4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md "mention"). Overall success.&#x20;

### Feature 2

The game's art style is engaging and interesing to look at and adds to the player experience in a positive way. The art work is not too distracting from the gameplay however, which would mean that the game is more difficult to play as you would struggle to focus on the player and enemies. This feature doesn't need any changes and is a success.&#x20;

## Error Tolerant

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature No.</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="select">Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Playing the game without crashes.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Able to play the game without game breaking bugs.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1

The game does not crash and instead is very stable, even when there are bugs or unexpected behaviour. Overall doesn't need to be changed in the games current state, and so is a success.

### Feature 2

The game does contain 2 game breaking bugs, where you are able to play the game without having to kill any enemies, however it does not earn any points. You are able to sit on the far right side of the screen and you avoid all enemies, as they only spawn on the left side, due to a bug in the pattern generation of the enemies.&#x20;

The fix to this bug is to correct the size of the area that the enemies spawn in, and making sure that they spawn over the entire play area. This would mean that the player is no longer able to sit on the far right side, and would mean the player has to be actively moving.&#x20;

Overall this is a fail as the bugs create a way to play the game that is not intended.&#x20;

## Easy To Learn

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature No.</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="select">Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The game is intuitive to play and pick up</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1

All the people who played my game in the [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") found the game easy to pick up and play and therefore is intuitive and well instructed on the aim of the game. Overall a success.&#x20;

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

This is criteria that don't fit into other categories and are simply usability feature that improve the game based off of the [1.5-success-criteria.md](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md "mention").

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="select">Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>The game is challenging but still completeable.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>The game becomes more difficult the longer you play.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>The challenges in the game should not require more than two people.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>21</td><td>The game is age appropriate.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1

The game is challenging but it is still possible to progress. This is aided by the criteria that outlines if the game becomes more challenging the longer you play. This feature has been shown via the [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention"), as all the testers found the game to get more difficult. Overall a success and is doesn't need adjustments.

### Feature 2

As outlined in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") the game gets more difficult as you play, making it more intense, and therefore more engaging and interesting to play. This also means that players get 'hooked' and want to be able to improve and get past a difficult section of the game. Overall a success and nothing needs to be changed.&#x20;

### Feature 3

At no point in the game do you require two or more people to be able to get further, and it is simply a test of how the player is able to progress which reflects their skill. This feature doesn't require changing and is a success.&#x20;

### Feature 4

The testers found that the game is suitable for people 7 and over, and this means that the game can be played by children of ages old enough to be able to access a computer. Overall this is a success and the game doesn't need any adjustments in gore or violence to be more suitable.&#x20;

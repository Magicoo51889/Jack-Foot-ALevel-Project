# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level Design

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                        | When was it achieved             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game is challenging but completable            | Achieved it in Usability Testing |
| 2         | Enemies would give another challenge               | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 3         | Each enemy is varied and has a unique visual to it | Achieved in Cycle 4 and Cycle 7  |
| 4         | The game gets more difficult as you progress       | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 5         | There must be some sort of obstacle                | Achieved in Cycle 4              |
| 6         | All puzzles should not require more than 1 person  | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 7         | Add waves to each enemy                            | Achieved in Cycle 4 and Cycle 7  |

### Criterion 1

I have successfully provided a game that is both enjoyable, and challenging whilst playing and made it so that it is easy to pick up and be enjoyable right from the beginning.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

I have successfully added two different varieties of enemy, that add a challenge to the game, and allow it to be more enjoyable, whilst also upholding an element of difficulty and skill required to play. This has been confirmed in the [#engaging](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging "mention") section of Usability Testing.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

I have added two different enemies and this means that players are more likely to want to continue playing the game as it allows them to explore the two varieties of enemy.

&#x20;

### Criterion 4

This has been confirmed via testing and my survey in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention"). The game is engaging and get progressively harder as you play.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

There are enemies that I've added and that the players found them engaging as showing in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") and adds a challenge to the game and this means that the game is more difficult, yet is still enjoyable.&#x20;

### Criterion 6

As confirmed in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") my game is single player and it doesn't require more players to be able to continue or to progress in the game. Works as intended.&#x20;

### Criterion 7

I've added waves to the enemies and they have patterns that they use to make them more predictable and to add an element of skill and remembering the way that the enemies spawn. Additionally the base enemies don't spawn if the boss enemies spawn, adding more predictability and making the game a little easier for newer players.&#x20;

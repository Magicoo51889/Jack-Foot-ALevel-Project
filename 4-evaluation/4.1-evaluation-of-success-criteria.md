# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Level Design

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                        | When was it achieved             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game is challenging but completable            | Achieved it in Usability Testing |
| 2         | Enemies would give another challenge               | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 3         | Each enemy is varied and has a unique visual to it | Achieved in Cycle 4 and Cycle 7  |
| 4         | The game gets more difficult as you progress       | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 5         | There must be some sort of obstacle                | Achieved in Cycle 4              |
| 6         | All puzzles should not require more than 1 person  | Achieved in Usability Testing    |
| 7         | Add waves to each enemy                            | Achieved in Cycle 4 and Cycle 7  |

### Criterion 1

I have successfully provided a game that is both enjoyable, and challenging whilst playing and made it so that it is easy to pick up and be enjoyable right from the beginning.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

I have successfully added two different varieties of enemy, that add a challenge to the game, and allow it to be more enjoyable, whilst also upholding an element of difficulty and skill required to play. This has been confirmed in the [#engaging](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging "mention") section of Usability Testing.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

I have added two different enemies and this means that players are more likely to want to continue playing the game as it allows them to explore the two varieties of enemy.

&#x20;

### Criterion 4

This has been confirmed via testing and my survey in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention"). The game is engaging and get progressively harder as you play.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

There are enemies that I've added and that the players found them engaging as showing in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") and adds a challenge to the game and this means that the game is more difficult, yet is still enjoyable.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The enemies add a challenge and an obstacle to achieving a higher high score</p></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 6

As confirmed in my [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention") my game is single player and it doesn't require more players to be able to continue or to progress in the game. Works as intended.&#x20;

### Criterion 7

I've added waves to the enemies and they have patterns that they use to make them more predictable and to add an element of skill and remembering the way that the enemies spawn. Additionally the base enemies don't spawn if the boss enemies spawn, adding more predictability and making the game a little easier for newer players.&#x20;

## Mechanics

### Criterion

| Criterion | Description                       | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | The player must be able to move   | Achieved in Cycle 2  |
| 2         | There must be collision detection | Achived in Cycle 4   |
| 3         | Fixed camera view                 | Achieved in Cycle 1  |
| 4         | High Score                        | Achieved in Cycle 9  |

### Criterion 1

I achieved this criterion in cycle 2, and it is a core mechanic of the game. Without this the game would not be possible and there would be no engagement from players.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

There must be collision detection to allow the player to shoot the players and to be able die if they crash into enemies.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-09-08 at 12.00.56 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The enemy exploding if hit by enough enemies</p></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 3

As shown in [cycle-1.md](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md "mention"), the view of the game doesn't move when moving the player side to side, which is essential for this style of game.&#x20;

### Criterion 4

As shown in [2.2.10-cycle-10-add-score-count.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10-add-score-count.md "mention") the high score is stored on the host's computer to keep the information between each time they play, and this allows the player to keep track of their highest score without having to write it down or remember it. This means that the game is easier to play, as you don't have to remember what score you get each time you play.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-10-19 at 11.44.05.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is high score that has been stored in the game, and is able to be shown when you come back after closing the game</p></figcaption></figure>

## User Interface

### Criterion

| Criterion | Description                                                    | When was it acheived               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1         | There must be a menu for the player                            | Would've been achieved in Cycle 11 |
| 2         | The player must smoothly change between the game and menu      | Would've been achieved in Cycle 11 |
| 3         | There must be a pause menu for the player with several options | Would've been achieved in Cycle 11 |
| 4         | The game must save                                             | Achieved in Cycle 9                |
| 5         | The player should be allowed to restart if they like           | Achieved in Cycle 10               |
| 6         | The menu must be clearly laid out and coloured appropriately   | Would've been achieved in Cycle 11 |

### &#x20;Criterion 1

I was implementing a menu in [2.2.11-cycle-11-add-pause-menu.md](../design-and-development/2.2.11-cycle-11-add-pause-menu.md "mention") but ran out of time to finish implementing the feature. I was having issues with the layout of the menu and the button to be able to open the menu.&#x20;

### Criterion 2

Whilst I never got to test the transition, from the performance of the rest of the game, I would surmise that it would transition smoothly, especially as the game itself would run smoothly, which is more computationally complex, and requires more rendering from the computer.&#x20;

### Criterion 3

This is the same scenario as criterion 1, where I didn't get to complete [2.2.11-cycle-11-add-pause-menu.md](../design-and-development/2.2.11-cycle-11-add-pause-menu.md "mention")so never got to implement the feature fully into the game, however the feature would be implemented if I had more time to add it to the game.&#x20;

### Criterion 4

This feature was achieved in [2.2.10-cycle-10-add-score-count.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10-add-score-count.md "mention") as the game remebers and saves the highest score achieved in the game before. This means that the player doesn't need to remeber the highest score they have achieved, making the game more accessible to new players.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

This criterion was achieved in [2.2.10-cycle-10-add-game-over-and-restart.md](../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10-add-game-over-and-restart.md "mention") and is able to restart when they die in game, without having to refresh the game again. This means that the experience is more seamless, imersive and enjoyable.&#x20;

### Criterion 6

For the menu I was planning on having a set of rounded squares that the user could click on using the mouse, as this would be intuitive for the player. However I ran out of time developing this, and didn't get to implement it. The menu would be intuitive to use however as there would be big, easily pressable labelled buttons for the user, which they could press to access different parts of the game.&#x20;

## Non-Functional

### Criterion

| Criterion | Description                                                          | When was it achieved                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game must run without crashing for an extended time              | Achieved in Testing for Function and Robustness |
| 2         | The game must run at at least 30 frames per second                   | Achieved in Testing for Function and Robustness |
| 3         | The game must be appropriate for the age of the audience of the game | Achieved in Usability Testing                   |

### Criterion 1

The game doesn't crash as I found out in the [3.1-robustness.md](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md "mention") and means that it is stable, and error tollerant.

### Criterion 2

As I found in [3.1-robustness.md](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md "mention") the game runs at 60fps, and is limited by the browser, not the full ablilty of the game. This shows that the game is properly optimised and works well.

### Criterion 3

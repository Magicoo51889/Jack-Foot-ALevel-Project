## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

The main bug at the moment is the issue with the enemies only spawning on the left side of the playable area. This means that the player can stay on the right side, and not be killed. Whilst this isn't game breaking, as the player doesn't earn any points for time they survive, they will theoretically be able to gain more and more points if the health pick-ups float into the player.&#x20;

* Fix enemy spawning on left side only
* Player can theoretically make points without playing the game

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

I would like to implement the menu and pause menu I was making, as this would make the game feel more complete and make it easier to navigate for new players. It also means that the player doens't imediately jump into the game as soon as they open the game, and allows the to get ready to play after they open the game.&#x20;

* Openable pause menu, through pressing 'esc' or by clicking on pause button in the top right
* Be able to quit to the main menu mid-game, from the pause menu
* Load the game into a main menu, which has settings available to press so that the user can navigate to the game, rather than imediatly playing as soon as the game opens.&#x20;

Additionally I'd like to implement set length levels to the game so that there is more variety in what the player can do in the game.&#x20;

* Set length levels, with waves of enemies
* Pick which game mode you'd like in the main menu

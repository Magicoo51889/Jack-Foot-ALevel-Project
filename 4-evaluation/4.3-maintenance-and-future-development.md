# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Only one game mode - Endless mode
* Could be hosted online for easier access to the game
* Not as fun as it could be
* More features need to be added to make it more involving to play

## Maintenance

The game would require different aspects of maintenance to tailor to the differnet aims and goals of the project, and this would require different strategies to be used to allow the game to grow.&#x20;

### Size of Program

To keep the game at its current size then, it would only need to undergo the short term fixes, as these would simply fix the issues that the current game has, and would not be adding any features to the game. The current limitations of the game do not need to be expanded, changed and retested for the game to work and would be outside of the scope of the project regardless as they lie outside of the specified requirements.&#x20;

In order to go through with the short term fixes the game would still be able to be developed by one person, and would not require external sources to add to it. The only other maintainence would be to make sure that the game remains hosted, and the website doesn't crash.&#x20;

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

The main bug at the moment is the issue with the enemies only spawning on the left side of the playable area. This means that the player can stay on the right side, and not be killed. Whilst this isn't game breaking, as the player doesn't earn any points for time they survive, they will theoretically be able to gain more and more points if the health pick-ups float into the player.&#x20;

* Fix enemy spawning on left side only
* Player can theoretically make points without playing the game

Additionally the game had issues being hosted online, and would require a few bug fixes ot be able to make the game run online, without having to be downloaded through a complicated installation process (which even though it has been made as easy as possible, is still confusing for people unfamiliar with command line and navigating directories).

As the code is on Github the game can be easily forked and adapted into someone elses version of the game, and those features can be merged with this main branch to add features or ideas from external sources.&#x20;

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

I would like to implement the menu and pause menu I was making, as this would make the game feel more complete and make it easier to navigate for new players. It also means that the player doens't imediately jump into the game as soon as they open the game, and allows the to get ready to play after they open the game.&#x20;

* Openable pause menu, through pressing 'esc' or by clicking on pause button in the top right
* Be able to quit to the main menu mid-game, from the pause menu
* Load the game into a main menu, which has settings available to press so that the user can navigate to the game, rather than imediatly playing as soon as the game opens.&#x20;

Additionally I'd like to implement set length levels to the game so that there is more variety in what the player can do in the game.&#x20;

* Set length levels, with waves of enemies
* Pick which game mode you'd like in the main menu
